  Our Project deal with off-line signature recognition &amp; verification using neural network in
which the human signature is captured and presented in the image format to the system.
Various image processing techniques, features extraction, neural network training of
extracted features and after performing all of these task we are going to do verification and
testing of the signature. After performing all of these task we will be able to identify whether
the signature is genuine or forged.
